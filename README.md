# WingifyTask

### Problem Statement:

There are 4 elements on the screen, an ImageView at the top, a title textview beneath that, followed by a content textView and finally a click me button at the bottom of the screen. Design an app such that, it records the user click event on that element and send the count for it to a dummy server. In case user is online send the count immediately, in case the user is offline, persist the counts for each click on each element and send once the user is back online. Post sending the persisted count, reset the persisted counter.
